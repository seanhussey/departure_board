Modified files:

app/controllers/departure_board_controller.rb
app/helpers/departure_board_helper.rb
app/views/departure_board/index.html.erb
config/application.rb

config/routes.rb

No database is required.

As long as a modern Ruby is installed (I used Ruby 2.5.0), then simply run with a vanilla `rails s` and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the departure board.
